Abstract:

Continuous Integration and continuous delivery are the key to code quality, product agility, and engineering velocity. In this session, youâ€™ll learn how your team can use GitHub, Heroku Pipelines, and Heroku CI to make continuous delivery simple and flexible. The Git-based methodology provides for a pipeline through which code begins as a fully executable pull request, goes through automated unit and integration tests, is automatically merged to test and staging apps, and is then deployed to production with a single click. Some customers are able to deploy features and fixes up to 500+ times a week, with very few rollbacks from production. Developers with an intermediate level of experience will benefit the most from this workshop.
