Josh W Lewis is a multi-discipline engineer who has been building
web applications and development tooling for nearly a decade. Lately, he's
been building new workflows for developers on GitHub, delivering
Heroku Pipelines and Review Apps and leading the development of Heroku CI as
part of a small, high-performance team.

## Abstract

Continuous Integration and continuous delivery are the key to code quality, product agility, and engineering velocity. In this session, youâ€™ll learn how your team can use GitHub, Heroku Pipelines, and Heroku CI to make continuous delivery simple and flexible. The Git-based methodology provides for a pipeline through which code begins as a fully executable pull request, goes through automated unit and integration tests, is automatically merged to test and staging apps, and is then deployed to production with a single click. Some customers are able to deploy features and fixes up to 500+ times a week, with very few rollbacks from production. Developers with an intermediate level of experience will benefit the most from this workshop.

## Prerequisites

2. An internet connection.
2. A web browser.
3. A Heroku account -- Get one free, [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).
4. (optional, reccomended) Verify your Heroku account with a credit card [here](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/billing). We'll be using free resources, but the advanced workflows require verification.
5. A GitHub account -- Get one free, [here](https://github.com/).


## Outline

### 0:00 - Introduction

- Hi, I'm Josh
- What is Heroku?
  - Brief description; TL;DR it's a PaaS
  - Quick walkthrough of demo app
- What are Heroku Pipelines?
  - A workflow designed for high-performing teams
  - Builds on workflows you already have in GitHub
  - Illustrate the full development workflow GIF

### 0:10 - Demo/Hook

- Showcase the entire workflow
  - Open a PR
  - Inspect the PR app
  - Check CI test results
  - Merge the PR
  - Watch staging auto-deploy
  - Inspect staging
  - Check CI results
  - Promote to prod

- Your turn! We'll guide you through
  - Setting up a Pipeline
  - Setting up automatic deploys to staging
  - Setting up automatic review apps
  - Setting up automatic CI runs
  - Setting up promotions to production
  - Taking a feature from development through staging and to production

### 0:25 - Prerequisites

- A web browser (tablet or laptop is fine, smartphone is harder, but should work)
- An internet connection
- A GitHub account (logged in)
- A Heroku account
- Pause for 5 minutes, staff helps folks get on wifi, create/login to accounts

### 0:30 - Iteration 1

- Walkthrough
  - Fork the sample repository
  - Create a staging app (via Heroku Button)
  - Add it to the pipeline
- Pause for Q&A, staff patrolling and helping perform steps

### 0:40 - Iteration 2

- Walkthrough
  - Connect pipeline to your repository
  - Enable automatic deploys
  - Enable review apps
- Pause for Q&A, staff patrolling and helping perform steps

### 0:50 - Iteration 3

- Walkthrough
  - Create production app (via Heroku Button)
  - Add it to the same pipeline
- Pause for Q&A, staff patrolling and helping perform steps

### 0:60 - Iteration 4

- Walkthrough
  - Enable CI
    - caveat: this step is optional because it costs a few cents and requires CC
- Short pause for Q&A, staff patrolling and helping perform steps

### 0:65 - Iteration 5

- Walkthrough
  - Ship a feature
    - Open a PR
    - Inspect the PR app
    - Check CI results for feature branch (if applicable)
    - Merge the PR
    - Watch auto-deploy to master
    - inspect staging app
    - Check CI results for master (if applicable)
